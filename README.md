FRC Team 3958's Official Infinite Recharge 2020 Robot Code

For programmers:
- For a comprehensive to-do list that should stay updated, refer to https://github.com/FRC3958/Official-2020-robot-code/projects/1
- Note each thing also has an accompanying "TODO:" in the code
- Do not mark something finished until it is a piece of the master branch. If changes are being made in another branch (as they should be), create a PULL REQUEST and wait for it to be peer-approved
